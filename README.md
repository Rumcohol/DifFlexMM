## üåÖ Why DifFlexMM?

üöÄ The goal of this framework is to push the boundary of designable dynamic behaviors achievable by nonlinear mechanical metamaterials.

ü§ñ Through the power of differentiable simulations, the framework removes the typical limitations of metamaterial design e.g. periodicity, intuition-based design, manual tuning, single-task design, etc., and enables the automated discovery of non-periodic, multi-functional, and reprogrammable metamaterials in the nonlinear dynamic regime.

## üöÅ Overview

This repository provides a fully differentiable dynamic design framework for 2D flexible mechanical metamaterials i.e. a network of rigid units connected by flexible ligaments.
The main physical ingredients of the model are:

- ü•å Rigid-body kinematics of the units.
- üéà Elastic ligaments modeled by customizable energy functions.
- üí• Energy-based contact interactions between rigid units.

With these ingredients, flexible mechanical metamaterials define a rich space of nonlinear dynamic behaviors that can be navigated by the framework.

üî≠ From a high-level perspective, the framework facilitates the construction of the mapping between design parameters and the desired behavior of the metamaterial system.

![Code mapping](docs/code_mapping.svg)

By leverging [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), this complex mapping is implemented in a differentiable fashion, thus allowing gradients to flow through the entire dynamic simulation.
In particular, differentiability is provided with respect to:

- Geometric paramaters: arbitrary parametrizations can be defined in the [`geometry`](difflexmm/geometry.py) module.
- Ligament paramaters: energy functions can be defined in the [`energy`](difflexmm/energy.py) module.
- Damping parameters: linear viscous damping as defined in the [`loading`](difflexmm/loading.py) module.
- Driving parameters: arbitrary driving functions can be applied to any degree of freedom.
- Loading parameters: arbitrary loading functions can be applied to any degree of freedom.
- Initial conditions: initial positions and velocities of the system.
- and any other paramater present in the [`ControlParams`](difflexmm/utils.py#L145-L163) data structure.

The main entry point of the simulator is the [`setup_dynamic_solver(...)`](difflexmm/dynamics.py#L60) in the [`dynamics`](difflexmm/dynamics.py) module.
This function takes all the fixed mappings (geometry, energy, loading, etc.) and returns a differentiable function that simulates the metamaterial dynamics.
Arbitrary forward problems can be defined by chaining this simulator function with any desired objective function.
